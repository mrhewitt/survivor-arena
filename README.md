#### Modifications

- Randomized rate at which mobs are spawned
- Added start and death "screens"

## Challenges

### Add a time limit to the game

Simple timer that shows win or dead screen after 120s

### Add a health bar

Mobs provide damage/second value, this is applied on each frame adjusted by delta as mobs collide with player. Progress bar used for display will also show green/orange/red as heath drops
